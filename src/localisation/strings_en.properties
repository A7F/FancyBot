onStart = *Welcome!* \nThis bot is supposed to work via _inline queries_: try me writing `@typerobot something` to see what I can do!\nAlso, check out the keyboard below: it may be useful and you may get some good infos. :)
onHelp = This bot works via _inline queries_: this means that you can use it everytime you want, everywhere! There's no need to add it inside group chats (and that's why I disabled this option).\nJust write this bot username and the text you want me to edit, then choose your preferred style in the menu will appear: that's it! As you may see, working is pretty straightforward.\n\nBy the way, sometimes may happen I can't fully edit your text. This is because some special ASCII characters are not supported as UNICODE. This is why in some styles numbers, exclamation marks or stuff like these are not properly converted... Sorry, that's not my fault ^^" \n\n*But what about those strange blank or crossed squares?*\nActually you should see normal texts with kind of wide spaced characters. If you see squares instead _your system doesn\u2019t support Unicode_, or _your current font can\u2019t handle these characters_.\n\n*Hey, the bot seems down!*\nYea... unfortunately I am just a student and I can't afford good VPS, so they may go offline sometime; by the way, I want this bot being completely free and without any kind of spam asking to donate or whatever. So, please if you notice that the bot goes down contact me and I will restore it as soon as possible.\n\n*Does this bot stores any user data?*\nThis bot *does not* collect any personal data of any kind: if you don't believe me, press `about` button on the keyboard and check out this bot code :)\nAnd yes, I know this choice somehow "limits" the bot but there are plenty good reasons behind this.\n\n*Do you plan to add more features?*\nActually, _yes_. Of course I want to add more "fonts", but suggestions are welcome, too. I'm currently facing the issue related to different visualisations between desktop client and mobile one but I think this is not related to this bot source code.
onHow = This bot performs conversions between ASCII chars and UNICODE chars: sometimes performs it using a standard array (i.e., in bubbles style), sometimes by adding to ASCII numeric value a constant (i.e., in monospaced style). \nSometimes may happen that numbers or special characters are not coverted properly: that's because the corresponding unicode character does not exists so I didn't loaded it inside my conversion arrays.\n\nIf you want to learn more, check out my github page and give a look to the code, it's free! :)
onAbout = you can check out this bot code on my GitHub page, here: \nhttps://github.com/A7F/FancyBot\nFeel free to pull and make any modifications, as you may see the code is totally open source but please, give credits :)\nOf course, _PRs are welcome_!\n\nYou can also get in touch with me writing to @overflowexception; please be patient while waiting for an answer, that is not my main account so it may take a while since you get an answer.\n\n*Do you have other bots?*\n*I do!* I made @pasterinobot , @ipaboutbot and @pongrobot . Why don't you give them a chance? The first one implements text smiles in chat, the second and the latter are network utilities :)\nYou can find them also on Bot Store right here:\nhttps://storebot.me/bot/pasterinobot\nhttps://storebot.me/bot/ipaboutbot\nhttps://storebot.me/bot/pongrobot\n\n_Feedbacks are appreciated :) _\n\n_Peace!_
