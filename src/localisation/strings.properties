onStart = *Welcome!* \nThis bot is supposed to work via _inline queries_: try me writing `@typerobot something` to see what I can do!\nAlso, check out the keyboard below: it may be useful and you may get some good infos. :)
onHelp = This bot works via _inline queries_: this means that you can use it everytime you want, everywhere! There's no need to add it inside group chats (and that's why I disabled this option).\nJust write this bot username and the text you want me to edit, then choose your preferred style in the menu will appear: that's it! As you may see, working is pretty straightforward.\n\nBy the way, sometimes may happen I can't fully edit your text. This is because some special ASCII characters are not supported as UNICODE. This is why in some styles numbers, exclamation marks or stuff like these are not properly converted... Sorry, that's not my fault ^^" \n\n*But what about those strange blank or crossed squares?*\nActually you should see normal texts with kind of wide spaced characters. If you see squares instead _your system doesn\u2019t support Unicode_, or _your current font can\u2019t handle these characters_.\n\nI *do not* collect any personal data of any kind: if you don't believe me, press `about` button on the keyboard and go checking out this bot code :)
onHow = This bot performs conversions between ASCII chars and UNICODE chars: sometimes performs it using a standard array (i.e., in bubbles style), sometimes by adding to ASCII numeric value a constant (i.e., in monospaced style). \nIf you want to learn more, check out my github page and give a look to the code, it's free! :)
onAbout = you can check out this bot code on my GitHub page, here: https://github.com/A7F/FancyBot . \nFeel free to pull and make any modification, as you may see the code is totally open source but please, give credits.\nOf course, _PRs are welcome_!\nYou can also get in touch with me writing to https://t.me/overflowexception ; please be patient while waiting for an answer, that is not my main account so it may take a while since you get an answer.\n\n_Peace!_
